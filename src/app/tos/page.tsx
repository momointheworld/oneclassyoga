      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Booking and Payments</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        All bookings and payments are processed securely through Stripe. You
        agree to provide accurate information during checkout.

        your own location for the class (e.g., your condo garden, a park, or
        another suitable space). However, if more than 2 participants attend, a
        studio is required.
