      "bio2": "What I noticed was that while Chiang Mai has amazing teachers, it can be hard to find a clear path to get better at a specific skill. I created this site to turn the 'random group class' experience into <b>focused, one-on-one programs</b>. This helps talented teachers get the exposure they deserve while giving you the personal attention needed to actually see progress."

      "p1": "I’ve seen students spend years in group classes without ever really mastering the skills they want, like inversions or a solid foundation. At the same time, I know teachers who are absolute experts in these areas but don't have a way to share that deep knowledge in a busy studio.",
      "p2": "I decided to work directly with these teachers to package their best skills into structured programs. This way, you aren't just \"doing yoga\"—you are following a clear path designed by an expert, just for you."
