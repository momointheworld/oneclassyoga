    "description": "I am a longtime practitioner in Chiang Mai and I’ve followed a lot of teachers over the years, learning their skills in different areas. I created this to help these teachers gain the exposure they deserve by putting together private, one-on-one programs built around their specific strengths. This allows students to progress with much more focus than a group class, with every session tailored to exactly what they need."
